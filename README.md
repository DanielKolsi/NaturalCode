# NaturalCode
Coding with natural language

This project tries to make it possible to build software (i.e. code) with a very high level programming language that
resembles natural language or pseudocode. 
It includes:

- frontend & backend programming
- CRUD / REST
- functional programming with pseudocode, e.g. match(user1, New York)
- keeps track of the abstraction level, the higher the level, the nearer the syntax is the natural language (e.g. natural   language = 100, assembler = 5)
- traces language abstraction level while performing the instructions
- possibility to execute instructions in different levels of abstraction

- conversion: natural language -> pseudocode -> functions -> machine code etc.
